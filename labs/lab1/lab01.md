# Lab01

The objective was to write A* algorithm implementing g() (the actual cost) and a new h() (heuristic cost): \
The actual cost g() is computed as the len of sets taken in the current state while the heuristic cost h() is the ratio between uncovered tiles and total number of sets. (worked with s314771)
